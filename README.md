# Automatic-Question-Generator
Our overall project is completely based on automatic formulation of questions using user
given input in the programming language python.We have used the NLP or Natural Language
Processing to reach our solution,wherein we used NLTK(Natural Language ToolKit).
A user can provide an input and the desired output will hence be generated.For instance,if a
user provides an input of a certain kind of question,similar types of questions will be
generated in a large amount.
Our project thus aims to generate the maximum possible kind of questions which can be
created from a similar question inputted by the user,hence resulting in less tedious and
repetitive work.
This was achieved through various algorithms,basis of all of which was to tokenize(break the
string to a list of individual elements) the user inputted question,recognize the keyword and
hence replace it with similar words.

For a question=”Suppose list1=[3,4,5,6,7,8],what is max(list1)?”,here ‘max’ is the keyword
and hence can be replaced with words like min,len,etc.
Also we created another kind of question from this inputted question,that is the contents of
the list1 stated above was changed and random integers were generated by providing a
specific range.
Similarly from one inputted question various kinds of other questions were generated.
Many different libraries were also imported to reach the desired output and have been
mentioned below in the implementation.
